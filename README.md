# Work Schedule

<br>

## Description

This project was created so that a user could keep track of their tasks on an hourly bases during a working day (9am-5pm). This project challenged me to take a deeper look into jQuery and its abilities. By using my prior knowledge of the fundamentals of JavaScript such as functions, for loops, if else statements, etc., I was able to translate those same abilities into jQuery. This project allowed me to practice more localStorage coding and use jQuery elements. Additionally, I was able to introduce  a new feature, dayjs(), that I had never used before. 

**NOTE: Please note that any code that is in HTML and CSS was not created by the author. Only the Javascript file has been written by the author with some pre-existing code. The code source is from a module in the UC Berkley Full Stack Flex Bootcamp.**

## Technology Used

- HTML - used to edit the existing elements.
- CSS - used to edit the styling for the html elements.
- Javascript - used to add function the application.
- Git - used to track edits made to the source code.
- GitHub - used to host and deploy the repository.
